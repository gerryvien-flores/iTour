             <p align = "justify" class = "intro">The Bicol region, also known administratively as Region V, is situated near the southeasterly tip of Luzon. Lamon Bay, the Visayan Sea, the Pacific Ocean, the Sibugan Sea, and Quezon Province form its northern, eastern, southern, and western borders, respectively. This region is comprised with six provinces namely Albay, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Catanduanes, Masbate, and Sorsogon. Bicol has a rough terrain. The tiny stretches of plain, which are mostly in Camarines Sur and Albay, are dwarfed by its hills. These include the Bulusan Volcano in Sorsogon, Mount Iriga, Mount Isarog, and the Calinigan mountain range in Camarines Sur, as well as the Mayon Volcano, Mount Malinao, and Mount Masaraga in Albay. The Lagonoy, Ragay, Albay, and Asian Gulf, the Sibugon Sea, Burias Pass, Ticao Pass, and Maqueda Channel, as well as the freshwater lakes of Buhi, Bato, and Baao in Camarines Sur and Bulusan Lake in Sorsogon, are significant bodies of water. Lamon Bay and San Miguel Bay are another important body of water. Over the region, it rains frequently and strongly; the annual precipitation averages over 2 meters, with Baras in Catanduanes having the highest amount—5.4 meters—in the nation.

            <h2 style = "text-indent: 40px;">A History of Bicol</h2>
            <p align = "justify" class = "intro">Bicol Region or Bicolandia is one of the 16 regions of the Philippines occupying the Bicol Peninsula at the southeastern end of Luzon island and some other islands. It consists of six provinces, namely, Albay, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Catanduanes, Masbate, and Sorsogon. It has one independent chartered city, Naga City, and six component cities, Iriga City, Legazpi City, Ligao City, Masbate City, Sorsogon City, and Tabaco City. The regional centers are Legazpi City, the region's political Center, and Naga City, the region's most progressive city and its commercial, educational, financial, religious, and cultural center. Inhabitants, called “Bicolanos,” speak any one of several dialects, including Bikol Rinconada (Iriga-Buhi area), Bikol Albay(Albay Province), Bikol Sorsogon (Sorsogon), Bikol Catanduanes and Bikol Partido (municipalities surrounding Lagonoy Gulf). StandardBikol is Bikol Naga, and it is generally understood by other Bikolspeakers. The Bicol region is often seen as the epicenter of the counter-culture and liberal politics in the Philippines. As many of its inhabitants seem to oppose many right-wing governments and ideology in which they blame for corruption. The region has a political reputation for voting always for the opposition. It is also widely seen as a stronghold for the National Democratic Front. Albay's archaeology shows concrete evidence of trade with China and Malaya/Indonesia going back two thousand years. The first Spanish contact was in 1565 when a treasure galleon returning to Cebu from Acapulco, Mexico, was swept off course and the captain recorded his awe at the sight of Mt. Mayon erupting. Mt.Mayon is the most prominent of the several volcanoes in the province, and one of the most famous jewels of the Pacific Ring of Fire; its eruptions have repeatedly inflicted disaster on the province and enriched the survivors. When at peace, it is a particularly beautiful mountain. Albay has a large amount of rich flat land, and agriculture is the largest component of the provincial economy. Coconuts, rice, abaca, and maize are the chief crops. Handicrafts bolster rural incomes. Commercial fishing is also important, and the province has several thousand manufacturing enterprises. There are plenty of places to visit, offering opportunities to swim at beautiful beaches, scuba-dive to wrecked galleons, explore caves, climb volcanoes, admire waterfalls, lush vegetation, Baroque architecture, etc. Gold mining and jewelry manufacturing continue to distinguish the province. Agriculture and fishing are major factors in the province's economy, and several handicrafts and small-scale industries are widely practiced. Tourism is insignificant, though Daethas become a destination for surfers. Bicol is composed of six provinces and 7 cities.</p>

            <p align = "justify" class = "intro">The region retains Roman Catholicism as the overwhelming religion of the great majority. The Catholic religion has the highest number of followers in any other area in the Philippines. Fiestas (Feast day of saints) are annual celebrations of parishes, from a simple barrio fiesta honoring a patron associated with a good harvest, to a town fiesta honoring a miraculous saint, or a regional one such as the Our Lady of Peñafrancia Fiesta, a week-long celebration to honor the Virgin Mary, dubbed as the "Queen Patroness of Bicolandia". It is widely acknowledged that in Luzon, it is the Bicol Region that holds the most number of men entering the seminary for the Catholic priesthood, or women entering the religious life to become Catholic nuns.</p>

The Bikol macro language is the dominant language of the region. The Filipino language (Tagalog) is also spoken in northern parts of Camarines Norte as well as in the municipality of Del Gallego, Camarines Sur.
