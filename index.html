             <p align = "justify" class = "intro">The Bicol region, also known administratively as Region V, is situated near the southeasterly tip of Luzon. Lamon Bay, the Visayan Sea, the Pacific Ocean, the Sibugan Sea, and Quezon Province form its northern, eastern, southern, and western borders, respectively. This region is comprised with six provinces namely Albay, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Catanduanes, Masbate, and Sorsogon. Bicol has a rough terrain. The tiny stretches of plain, which are mostly in Camarines Sur and Albay, are dwarfed by its hills. These include the Bulusan Volcano in Sorsogon, Mount Iriga, Mount Isarog, and the Calinigan mountain range in Camarines Sur, as well as the Mayon Volcano, Mount Malinao, and Mount Masaraga in Albay. The Lagonoy, Ragay, Albay, and Asian Gulf, the Sibugon Sea, Burias Pass, Ticao Pass, and Maqueda Channel, as well as the freshwater lakes of Buhi, Bato, and Baao in Camarines Sur and Bulusan Lake in Sorsogon, are significant bodies of water. Lamon Bay and San Miguel Bay are another important body of water. Over the region, it rains frequently and strongly; the annual precipitation averages over 2 meters, with Baras in Catanduanes having the highest amount—5.4 meters—in the nation.

             <p align = "justify" class = "intro">The name Ibalon, which means "people from the other side" or "people who are hospitable and give visitors gifts to bring home," has been variously interpreted to refer to the Bicol region. It may also be a corruption of Gibalong, which is now a sitio of Barangay San Isidro, Sorsogon, where the Spaniards first arrived in 1569. Spanish writings first made reference to the Bico River in 1572. Los Camarines was another name for the area, derived from the houses the Spanish discovered at Camalig, Albay.</p>
