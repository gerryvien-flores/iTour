                 <p class = "adjust" align = "justify">The ideal location for butanding, or snorkeling with whale sharks, is Donsol in southeast Luzon. The largest school of whale sharks in the world may move here every year from November to May to feed on the abundant plankton and krill in the region. Whale shark interactions at Donsol are strictly controlled to safeguard the animals and their habitat. It is entirely up to chance whether they show up or not because they are not kept as pets and are not fed by the local fishermen. You are taken out to the bay in a small boat, where spotters signal for you to jump in and swim with the whale sharks as they approach the surface. Being so close to these massive animals is an amazing experience.which in Donsol are normally four to twelve meters long (though residents claim, of course, to have seen larger). They have the appearance of spotted submarines, but fortunately they are kind and remarkably graceful.</p>
